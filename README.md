# PicoScope 2000 Series (A API) - MATLAB Generic Instrument Driver

This MATLAB® Generic Instrument Driver allows you to acquire data from the PicoScope® 2000 Series USB oscilloscopes and mixed signal oscilloscopes, and 
control signal generator functionality. The data could be processed in MATLAB using functions from Toolboxes such as [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html). 

This Instrument Driver package includes the following: 

* The MATLAB Generic Instrument Driver 
* Example scripts that demonstrate how to call functions in order to capture data in various collection modes, as well as using the signal generator.

* The driver can be used with the Test and Measurement Tool to carry out the following: 

  * Acquire data in Block mode 
  * Acquire data in Rapid Block mode 
  * Use the Built-in Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator

## Supported Models

The driver will work with the following PicoScope models:

* PicoScope 2206/7/8 (including ‘A’ and 'B' models)
* PicoScope 2405A
* PicoScope 2406/7/8B
* PicoScope 2205 MSO and 2205A MSO
* PicoScope 2206/7/8B MSO 

**Note:** 

For PicoScope 2104, 2105, 2202, 2203, 2204, 2204A, 2205 and 2205A models, please use the the 
[PicoScope 2000 Series - MATLAB Generic Instrument Driver](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40134-picoscope-2000-series-matlab-generic-instrument-driver).
