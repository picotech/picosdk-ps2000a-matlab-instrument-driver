# PicoScope 2000 Series (A API) - MATLAB Generic Instrument Driver

This MATLAB® Generic Instrument Driver allows you to acquire data from the PicoScope<sup>®</sup> 2000 Series USB oscilloscopes and mixed signal oscilloscopes, and 
control signal generator functionality. The data could be processed in MATLAB using functions from Toolboxes such as [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html). 

This Instrument Driver package includes the following: 

* The MATLAB Generic Instrument Driver 
* Example scripts that demonstrate how to call functions in order to capture data in various collection modes, as well as using the signal generator.

* The driver can be used with the Test and Measurement Tool to carry out the following: 

  * Acquire data in Block mode 
  * Acquire data in Rapid Block mode 
  * Use the Built-in Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator

## Supported Models

The driver will work with the following PicoScope models:

* PicoScope 2206/7/8 (including 'A' and 'B' models)
* PicoScope 2405A
* PicoScope 2406/7/8B
* PicoScope 2205 MSO and 2205A MSO
* PicoScope 2206/7/8B MSO 

**Note:** 

For PicoScope 2104, 2105, 2202, 2203, 2204, 2204A, 2205 and 2205A models, please use the the 
[PicoScope 2000 Series - MATLAB Generic Instrument Driver](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40134-picoscope-2000-series-matlab-generic-instrument-driver).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for Microsoft Windows (32- or 64-bit) or Linux operating systems (64-bit).
* [Instrument Control Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/instrument/)
* The [PicoScope Support Toolbox](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53681-picoscope-support-toolbox)
* The [PicoSDK C Wrapper Binaries](https://github.com/picotech/picosdk-c-wrappers-binaries)

**Notes:**

* MATLAB 2015b is recommended for 32-bit versions of MATLAB on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

### Installing the Instrument Driver files

We recommend using the [Add-Ons Explorer](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) in MATLAB in order to install these files and obtain updates.

If your version of MATLAB does not have the Add-Ons Explorer, download the zip file from the [MATLAB Central File Exchange page](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55504-picoscope-2000-series--a-api--matlab-generic-instrument-driver)
 and add the root and sub-folders to the MATLAB path.

### Installing drivers

Drivers are available for the following platforms. Refer to the subsections below for further information.

#### Windows

* Download the PicoSDK (32-bit or 64-bit) driver package installer from our [Downloads page](https://www.picotech.com/downloads).

#### Linux

* Follow the instructions from our [Linux Software & Drivers for Oscilloscopes and Data Loggers](https://www.picotech.com/downloads/linux) to install the required `libps2000a` and `libpswrappers` driver packages.

### User's Guides

A User Guide is available via the Documentation sub-menu item in the MATLAB Help menu. Please refer to the Supplemental Software section.
