%
% *Platform Specific Information:-*
%
% Microsoft Windows: Download the Software Development Kit installer from
% the <https://www.picotech.com/downloads Pico Technology Download software and manuals for oscilloscopes and data loggers> page.
% 
% Linux: Follow the instructions to install the libps2000a and libpswrappers
% packages from the <https://www.picotech.com/downloads/linux Pico Technology Linux Software & Drivers for Oscilloscopes and Data Loggers> page.
%
% Apple Mac OS X: Follow the instructions to install the PicoScope 6
% application from the <https://www.picotech.com/downloads Pico Technology Download software and manuals for oscilloscopes and data loggers> page.
% Optionally, create a |maci64| folder in the same directory as this file
% and copy the following files into it:
%
% * libps2000a.dylib and any other libps2000a library files
% * libps2000aWrap.dylib and any other libps2000aWrap library files
% * libpicoipp.dylib and any other libpicoipp library files
